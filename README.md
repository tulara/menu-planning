# Simple Meal Planner

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the weekly meal planner. It's a small vanilla JS app that displays breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day of the week with some mock meals.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — populates mock meals

No build step required; just open the HTML file.
